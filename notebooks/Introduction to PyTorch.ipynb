    "\n",
    "A `Variable` is a thin wrapper around a `Tensor` object, that also holds the gradient w.r.t. to it, and a reference to a function that created it. This reference allows retracing the whole chain of operations that created the data. If the Variable has been created by the user, its `grad_fn`will be `None` and we call such objects *leaf* Variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the variable has *not* been created by the user, its `grad_fn` refers to a `Function` object that has created the variable. The combination of `grad_fn` and `Function` defines an acyclic graph of operations (the forward step) on which we can call the `backward()` operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Tensor` object the variable is wrapped around is contained in the `data` attribute. The gradient is stored in the `grad` attribute, it matches type and location of `data` and cannot be reassigned. The `requires_grad` attribute allows excluding subgraphs. The `excluding-subgraphs` section referred to below can be found [here](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/autograd.html?highlight=excluding%20subgraphs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since autograd only supports scalar valued function differentiation, grad size always matches the data size. Also, grad is normally only allocated for leaf variables, and will be always zero otherwise."
